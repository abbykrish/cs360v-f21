## Guest Bootloader and Kernel; Understanding vmlaunch and vmresume

In this lab assignment you will be completing the Guest bootloader and kernel code.
You will be implementing the memory manipulation code to copy the guest kernel and bootloader into the VM.
You will also familiarize yourself with the assembly code that helps launch/resume the JOS VM.

Before beginning this lab assignment, read [bootloader.md](https://github.com/vijay03/cs360v-f20/blob/master/bootloader.md).

### Mapping in the guest bootloader and kernel

In user/vmm.c we have provided the structure of the code to set up the guest and bootloader.
In this lab assignment, you will be implementing the functions `copy_guest_kern_gpa` that copies the guest kernel code into the guest physical address (gpa).
You will also implement the function `map_in_guest` that copies the bootloader into the guest.

Like any other user application in JOS, the vmm has the ability to open files, read pages, and map pages into other environments via IPC.
For supporting this, we have added a new system call `sys_ept_map`, which you must implement in kern/syscall.c.
The high-level difference between `sys_ept_map` and `sys_page_map` is whether the page is added using extended page tables or regular page tables.

Skim Chapter 28.2 of the [Intel manual](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf)
to familiarize yourself with low-level EPT programming. Several helpful definitions have been provided in vmm/ept.h.

### Part-1 Pre-lab Questions 
1. What does it mean for there to be EPT support, vs. software driven virtualization? 
How do we know our VM has EPT support? 

2. ELF Headers:  
What is an ELF header? 
What does it do? 
Can you find what the ELF format for our VM is?

3. Set a breakpoint at the function `load_icode()` in env.c
What do you notice about the Proghdr object? 
What kinds of metadata does the object have? 
What is this function doing? It is described in the function header, but try to put it in your own words. 

4. The first function you implement in this project will have you check many errors, prior to the actual function logic. What are some of the reasons why we must do this in OS level code, the user never sees? 

Recommended files to look through before starting:

`inc/memlayout.h` describes and provides an ASCII image of the virtual memory map. 

`inc/mmu.h` describes how to parse information about a page from the address itself 

`vmm/ept.h` has function declarations that will be helpful throughout, and a macro for page table walks 

`lib/fd.c` has system calls that can be used to read files 

### Part-2 Coding Assignment

Implement `sys_ept_map()` in kern/syscall.c, as well as `ept_lookup_gpa()` and `ept_map_hva2gpa()` in vmm/ept.c.
Once this is complete, you should have complete support for nested paging.
The hints for implementing these functions are present as comments in the code.

Don't forget to error check! 

At this point, you have enough host-level support function to map the guest bootloader and kernel into the guest VM.
For mapping the guest bootloader and kernel, you will need to read the kernel's ELF headers and copy the segments into the guest.

### Part-3 Coding Assignment

Implement `copy_guest_kern_gpa()` and `map_in_guest()` in user/vmm.c.

On a high level, in this section, each page of the kernel as well as the bootloader is mapped from the host
to the guest at particular physical addresses, and thus the kernel and the bootloader becomes available to the guest for when the guest is launched.

Here is a graphic of the workflow, with descriptions below: 
![Image of Workflow](https://github.com/abbykrish/cs360v-f21/blob/main/figures/workflow.jpg)

For the bootloader, we use map_in_guest directly, since the bootloader is only 512 bytes,
whereas the kernel's ELF header must be read by copy_guest_kern_gpa, which should then call map_in_guest for each segment.

The workflow (and hints) for this part is as follows:
1. `copy_guest_kern_gpa()` reads the ELF header from the kernel executable into the struct Elf. 
The kernel ELF contains multiple segments which must be copied from the host to the guest. This function is similar to the one observed in the prelab but has to call something other than memcpy() to map the memory because we are in the virtual guest. 

2. `map_in_guest()` breaks down each segment in number of pages, and calls `sys_ept_map()` for each page. You cannot pass in the page directly, but rather will have to use a TEMP variable. This is defined as a macro in `memlayout.h`

3. `sys_ept_map()` first walks the page table levels at the host (given the srcva), and then gets
the physical page corresponding to the virtual address srcva (i.e. it returns the struct PageInfo).
The corresponding virtual address of this page is then computed using `page2kva()`, which basically acts as the hva in the call to `ept_map_hva2gpa()`.

4. `ept_map_hva2gpa()` does a walk on the page table levels at the guest (given the gpa) using `ept_lookup_gpa()` and then gets a page table entry at level 0 corresponding to the gpa. This function then inserts the physical address corresponding to the hva, in the page table entry returned by `ept_lookup_gpa()`.

5. `ept_lookup_gpa()` does the walk on the page table hierarchy at the guest and returns the page table entry
corresponding to a gpa. It calculates the next index using the address and iterates until it reaches the page table entry at level 0 which points to the actual page.

Once this is complete, the kernel will attempt to run the guest, and will panic because asm_vmrun is incomplete. This error looks like:
```
kernel panic on CPU 0 at ../vmm/vmx.c:637: asm_vmrun is incomplete
```

### Part-3 vmlaunch and vmresume

In this exercise, you will use the assembly code below to complete the `asm_vmrun()` that launches the VM.
The code below will help you use the vmwrite instruction to set the host stack pointer,
as well as the vmlaunch and vmresume instructions to start the VM.

In order to facilitate interaction between the guest and the JOS host kernel, we copy the guest register state into the environment's Trapframe structure.
Thus, you will also write assembly to copy the relevant guest registers to and from this trapframe struct.

Please remember, prior to starting this section, that your code from Lab 0 that implemented env-runs is correct and complete. Please refer to the TA if you did not recieve full marks. 

Skim Chapter 26 of the [Intel manual](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf)
to familiarize yourself with the vmlaunch and vmresume instructions. 
Remove the panic in the call to `asm_vmrun()`. There are instructions in the code of what lines you must add or fix. 

There are 3 places you need to add to in this function. Both are labeled in the codebase with "Your code here"

1. The first instruction can be found in the Intel manual, linked above. The instruction needs to set the VMCS rsp to the current top of the frame. 
2. The second instruction needs to check if vmlaunch (env-runs = 1) or vmresume (env-runs > 1) is needed, set the condition code appropriately for use below.
3. The last code to write will require a set of instructions. You must check the result of the condition flag, you set in step 2, and execute either the vmlaunch or the vmresume. This will require making use of conditional jumps. 

Once this is complete, you should be able to run the VM until the guest attempts a vmcall instruction, which traps to the host kernel.
Because the host isn't handling traps from the guest yet, the VM will be terminated. You should see an error like:

```
Unhandled VMEXIT, aborting guest.
```
