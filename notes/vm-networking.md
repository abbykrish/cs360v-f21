* Review previous class: Shadow Page Tables
* Discuss Memory Virtualization with hardware support: Nested Paging

* Problem: processing network in a virtualized setting
    * When packet arrives, VM that is currently running gets interrupted
    * Hypervisor determines which VM the packet should go to
    * Target VM may be involved in copying packet over, and immediately processing it if required
    * When this is done, the interrupted VM can run again
    * This drastically reduces performance if a lot of network IO is done
    * Key bottleneck: Hypervisor is involved in deciding where each packet should go
* Lets look at Hardware Support for IO
* Virtual Machine Device Queues (VMDQ)
    * Hardware determines which VM each packet is meant for
    * Places packet on queue for each VM
    * Hypervisor *still involved* in copying over data from each queue into each VM
    * VMDQ removes sorting overhead from hypervisor
* Single Root IO Virtualization (SR-IOV)
    * Introduces "Network Functions" Drivers
    * The hardware resources of the network adaptor (such as memory, registers, and queues) are split up among "network functions"
        * Each network function has *dedicated* access to a set of hardware resources
            * Each network function can then be bound to a specific VM
        * When a packet arrives for a specific VM, the network function of that VM is responsible for processing that packet
            * It can do so without interference from other VMs
    * What happens when there are more virtual machines than virtual network adaptors?
      * Several VMs have to share the same Virtual Function
    * Difference with VMDQ:
        * Hypervisor no longer involved in copying data over to the VM
        * Hypervisor completely removed from the loop, only involved in setup phase
        * VMDQ has different queue for each VM, SR-IOV has different Virtual Function for each VM
* The packet processing game:
    * 10 Gbps delivers 14.8M packets per second (assuming 64 byte packets and 20 byte pre-amble)
    * That gives us 67 ns to process a single packet
    * 67 ns is about 200 cycles on a 3 Ghz processor -- not a lot
    * For comparison: 
        * A cache miss is 32 ns
        * L2 cache access 4 ns
        * L3 cache access 8 ns
        * Atomic lock operation : 8 ns
        * Syscall: 40 ns
        * TLB miss: several cache misses
    * Need to batch and process packets
    * What to avoid:
        * A context switch: > 1000 ns
        * A page fault: > 1000 ns 
* **Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)**
* Open-source project with contributions from Intel and others
    * C code (GCC 4.5.X or later)
    * Linux kernel 2.6.34 or later
    * With kernel boot option isolcpus
* Set of user-space libraries for fast packet processing
    * Can handle 11x the traffic of the Linux kernel! 
* Lightweight, low level, performance driven framework
* All traffic bypasses the kernel
* Started with Intel x86, now supports other architectures like IBM Power 8
* Poll Mode Driver (PMD) per Hardware NIC
    * Support for RX/TX (Receive and Transmit)
    * Mapping PCI memory
    * Mapping user memory onto NIC
    * Managing hardware support
    * Implemented as a user space pthread
    * PMD drivers are non pre-emptive, not thread-safe
    * Threads communicate using librte_ring: lockless queue
* User space libraries
    * Initialize and use PMD
    * Provide threads (based on pthread)
    * Memory management
        * Used with Huge Pages (2 MB, 1 GB)
    * Hashing, scheduler, pipelining etc
* All resources initialized at the start 
* Implementation Tricks:
    * Donâ€™t use linked lists
    * Use arrays instead
* What does a basic forwarding example do?
    * DPDK Init
    * Get all available nics
    * Initialize packet buffers (create mem pool)
    * Initialize ports
* PMD loop for forwarding:
    * Get burst of packets from first port in port-pair
    * Send packets to second port in port-pair
    * Free unsent packets
    * Do this in a loop
* RTE Ring
    * Fixed sized, "lockless", queue ring
    * Non Preemptive.
    * Supports multiple/single producer/consumer, and bulk actions.
    * Uses:
        * Single array of pointers.
        * Head/tail pointers for both producer and consumer (total 4 pointers).
    * To enqueue (Just like dequeue):
        * Until successful:
            * Save in local variable the current head_ptr.
            * head_next = head_ptr + num_objects
            * CAS the head_ptr to head_next
        * Insert objects.
        * Until successful:
            * Update tail_ptr = head_next + 1 when tail_ptr == head_ptr
    * Analysis:
        * Light weight.
        * In theory, both loops are costly.
        * In practice, as all threads are cpu bound, the amortized cost is low for the first loop, and very unlikely at the second loop.
* RTE Mempool
    * Spread objects across different channels of the DRAM controller (different channels can be concurrently accessed)
    * Maintain a per-core cache, send requests in bulk to mempool ring
* Performance Evaluation:
    * DPDK can forward 22 M pps (L3 forwarding, NIC port to NIC port)
    * DPDK can forward 11 M pps (PHY-OVS-PHY)
    * DPDK can forward 2 M pps (NIC to VM to OVS to VM to NIC)
    * 4X40Gb ports
    * E5-2695 V4 2.1Ghz Processor
    * 16X1GB Huge Pages, 2048X2MB Huge Pages
