* Kubeless
  * Functions are represented as Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)
    * A custom resource is an extension of Kubernetes API (new kind of
      object)
    * A CRD groups together custom resources of one type
    * Controller running as a service, checks for changes to CRD
  * Serverless function deployed using ConfigMaps
  * Kafka/Zookeeper running to handle events
  * Init container used to handle dependencies (such as runtime for function)
  * kubeless deploys the controller, Kafka to initialize
  * How are functions triggered?
    * Through HTTP requests
      * The container running the function has a REST wrapper
    * Through events
      * Topics created on Kafka broker
      * An event goes to a specific topic
      * Function is triggered when event is published
