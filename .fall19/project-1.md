### Introduction
This project will guide you through writing a basic paravirtual hypervisor. We will use the JOS operating system running on a qemu emulator. Check the [tools page](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/tools.htm) for getting an overview of JOS and useful commands of QEMU. The main topics covered in this project are: bootstrapping a guest OS, programming extended page tables, emulating privileged instructions, and using hypercalls to implement hard drive emulation over a disk image file.

### Getting Started

To fetch the source for this project, use gitolite:
```
git clone cs378-vijay@git.cs.utexas.edu:<groupname>-project1
```

To push the code to the repository you need to use:
```
git push origin master
```

Additionally, The source for this project is present in this repository: [project-1.tar.gz](https://github.com/vijay03/cs378-f19/blob/master/project-1.tar.gz)
Untar it with the following command: `tar -xvf project-1.tar.gz`

The submission of the code will be done through gitolite. Please use gitolite in order to modify the source code, commit and push your code. Commits made until midnight on the day of the submission deadline will be used for grading.

You need access to kvm module for this project. So please use one of the following (gilligan) lab machines for this project:
1. ginger
2. lovey
3. mary-ann
4. skipper
5. the-professor
6. thurston-howell-iii

You can also enable qemu-kvm on your personal laptops / computers and work on the project.

### Using a server for the project
There are accounts created for all the groups on a server named "thoothukudi-lom". The projects will run much faster on the server as compared to the VM. So if you are not able to use the VM on the lab machines or you are finding the VMs to be too slow, you can use the server.

The thoothukudi-lom sits behind a gateway server called "pig". If you want to use thoothukudi-lom for the project, please follow the steps below:
1. add the following lines to the ~/.ssh/config file of the machine which you will use to ssh into the server:
```
Host thoothukudi-lom
    ProxyCommand ssh cs378@pig.csres.utexas.edu -W %h:%p
```
2. Log in to the server using the following command each time:
```
$ ssh cs378-<groupname>@thoothukudi-lom
```
3. After you log in, you should be able to clone the project in the usual way, and run it without any VM.

Please not that you *do not* need to create ssh key on the thoothukudi server. I have pre-created the ssh keys for all the accounts and added to your respective repositories. You should be able to clone the project directly as soon as you log in to the server. Also, since the thoothukudi-lom server sits behind the pig gateway, your keys need to be added to the pig server as well. For that, I have added all the keys that you have sent me so far in the pig server. So you can use any of the machines whose keys you have sent me till now to ssh into thoothukudi-lom. If you want to use a different machine to ssh into thoothukudi-lom, please send me the ssh public key of that machine.

2 more servers have been set up for the project.
1. erode-lom server. The setup for this is the same as the thoothukudi-lom server. So just replace "thoothukudi-lom" with "erode-lom" in setting up this server.
2. udipi server. In order to log in to this server, you don't need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file. You can directly log in using the command:
```
$ ssh cs378-<groupname>@udipi.csres.utexas.edu
```

### Using a Virtual Machine for the project
If you want to use a Virtual Machine for the project, please follow the steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/vijay03/cs378-f19/blob/master/project-1-vm-setup.md) for setting up the VM.

### Setup GDB
The standard version of gdb does not correctly handle the transition to long mode during JOS boot, yielding a "Packet too long" error. For debugging 64-bit code on a 32-bit platform, you need both gdb and gdb-multiarch. Below we post patched Ubuntu package.
[gdb_7.7.1](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/gdb_7.7.1-0ubuntu5~14.04.2_amd64.deb)

#### Installation
If you are using the gilligan lab machines, install gdb using following command:
```
$ dpkg -x gdb_7.7.1-0ubuntu5_14.04.2_amd64.deb $HOME/gdb_7.7
GDB executable can be found at $HOME/gdb_7.7/usr/bin
```
If you are using personal machines, install gdb using following command:
```
$ sudo dpkg -i gdb_7.7.1-0ubuntu5_14.04.2_amd64.deb
```
gdb7.7 requires python3.4 to run. Download and install python3.4 as given below:
```
$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.5/Python-3.4.5rc1.tar.xz
$ tar xf Python-3.4.5rc1.tar.xz
$ cd Python-3.4.5rc1
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/python3.4 --enable-shared --with-threads
$ make
$ make install
```
After installing python3.4 and gdb7.7, open $HOME/.bashrc and add the following lines:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/stage/public/ubuntu64/lib:$HOME/python3.4/lib
export PATH=$HOME/gdb7.7/usr/bin:$PATH
```
Finally, open (create if doesn't exist) $HOME/.gdbinit and add the following line:
```
set auto-load safe-path /
```

#### Using GDB
Open a terminal window, type `source ~/.bashrc` to set the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH. Use following commands:
```
$ cd <project-repo>/project-1
$ make clean
$ make
$ make run-vmm-gdb-nox
```
Open another terminal window, type `source ~/.bashrc` to set the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH. Use following commands:
```
$ cd <project-repo>/project-1
$ gdb
```
This will allow you to use GDB and set breakpoints in the code.

### Part 1 - VMM Bootstrap
The JOS VMM is launched by a fairly simple program in user/vmm.c. This application calls a new system call to create an environment (similar to a process) that runs in guest mode (sys_env_mkguest). Once the guest is created, the VMM then copies the bootloader and kernel into the guest's physical address space, marks the environment as runnable, and waits until the guest exits.

You will need to implement key pieces of the supporting system calls for the VMM, as well as some of the copying functionality.

Compile the code using the command:
```
$ make clean
$ make
```
Please note that the compilation works with gcc version less than or equal to 5.0.0. If you decide to use one of the gilligan lab machines mentioned above for the project, please modify line 77 of GNUmakefile to the following:
```
CC      := $(GCCPREFIX)gcc-4.8 -pipe
```
This will make sure that you use gcc-4.8 for compilation of JOS. The compile using the commands above.

You can try running the vmm from the shell in your guest by typing:
```
$ make run-vmm-nox
```
This will currently panic the kernel because the code to detect vmx and extended page table support is not implemented, but as you complete the project, you will see this launch a JOS-in-JOS environment. You will see an error like `kernel panic on CPU 0 at ../vmm/vmx.c:65: vmx_check_support not implemented`

#### Making a guest environment
The JOS bookkeeping for sys_env_mkguest is already provided for you in kern/syscall.c. You may want to skim this code, as well as the code in kern/env.c to understand how environments are managed. A major difference between a guest and a regular environment is that a guest has its type set to ENV_TYPE_GUEST and has a VmxGuestInfo structure and a vmcs structure associated with it.

The vmm directory includes the kernel-level support needed for the VMM--primarily extended page table support.

Your first task will be to implement detection that the CPU supports vmx and extended paging. Do this by checking the output of the cpuid instruction and reading the values in certain model specific registers (MSRs).

Read Chapters 23.6, 24.6.2, and Appendices A.3.2-3 from the [Intel manual](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf) to learn how to discover if the CPU supports vmx and extended paging.

Once you have read these sections, implement the `vmx_check_support()` and `vmx_check_ept()` functions in vmm/vmx.c. You will also need to add support to `sched_yield()` to call vmxon() when launching a guest environment.

If these functions are properly implemented, an attempt to start the VMM will not panic the kernel, but will fail because the vmm can't map guest bootloader and kernel into the VM. The error should look something like `Error copying page into the guest - 4294967289`

#### Mapping in the guest bootloader and kernel
In user/vmm.c we have provided the structure of the code to set up the guest and bootloader. However, you must implement the memory manipulation code to copy the guest kernel and bootloader into the VM.

Like any other user application in JOS, the vmm has the ability to open files, read pages, and map pages into other environments via IPC. One difference is that we've added a new system call sys_ept_map, which you must implement. The high-level difference between sys_ept_map and sys_page_map is whether the page is added using extended page tables or regular page tables.

Skim Chapter 28.2 of the [Intel manual](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf) to familiarize yourself with low-level EPT programming. Several helpful definitions have been provided in vmm/ept.h.

Implement `sys_ept_map()` in kern/syscall.c, as well as `ept_lookup_gpa()` and `ept_map_hva2gpa()` in vmm/ept.c. Once this is complete, you should have complete support for nested paging.

At this point, you have enough host-level support function to map the guest bootloader and kernel into the guest VM. You will need to read the kernel's ELF headers and copy the segments into the guest.

Implement `copy_guest_kern_gpa()` and `map_in_guest()` in user/vmm.c. For the bootloader, we use map_in_guest directly, since the bootloader is only 512 bytes, whereas the kernel's ELF header must be read by copy_guest_kern_gpa, which should then call map_in_guest for each segment.

The workflow (and hints) for this part is as follows:
1. `copy_guest_kern_gpa()` reads the ELF header from the kernel executable (using system calls present in lib/fd.c) into the struct Elf. The kernel ELF contains multiple segments which must be copied from the host to the guest. So this function loops over all the segment headers (i.e. program headers) and calls `map_in_guest()` for each of these segments. Each segment also contains the `gpa` that should be passed to `map_in_guest()`
2. `map_in_guest()` breaks down each segment in number of pages, loads each page into `UTEMP`, and calls `sys_ept_map()` for each page by passing the `UTEMP` as the srcva.
3. `sys_ept_map()` first walks the page table levels at the host (given the srcva), and then gets the physical page corresponding to the virtual address srcva (i.e. it returns the struct PageInfo). The corresponding virtual address of this page is then computed using `page2kva()`, which basically acts as the hva in the call to `ept_map_hva2gpa()`.
4. `ept_map_hva2gpa()` does a walk on the page table levels at the guest (given the gpa) using `ept_lookup_gpa()`, and then gets a page table entry at level 0 corresponding to the gpa. This function then inserts the physical address corresponding to the hva, in the page table entry returned by `ept_lookup_gpa()`.
5. `ept_lookup_gpa()` does the walk on the page table hierarchy at the guest and returns the page table entry corresponding to a gpa. It does this by making use of the `ADDR_TO_IDX` macro in vmm/ept.h starting from the top-most EPT level, till it reaches the page table entry at level 0 which points to the actual page.

On a high level, in this section, each page of the kernel as well as the bootloader is mapped from the host to the guest at particular physical addresses, and thus the kernel and the bootloader becomes available to the guest for when the guest is launched.

Once this is complete, the kernel will attempt to run the guest, and will panic because asm_vmrun is incomplete. The error should look like: `kernel panic on CPU 0 at ../vmm/vmx.c:637: asm_vmrun is incomplete`

#### Implementing vmlaunch and vmresume
In this exercise, you will need to write some assembly to launch the VM. Although much of the VMCS setup is completed for you, this exercise will require you to use the vmwrite instruction to set the host stack pointer, as well as the vmlaunch and vmresume instructions to start the VM.

In order to facilitate interaction between the guest and the JOS host kernel, we copy the guest register state into the environment's Trapframe structure. Thus, you will also write assembly to copy the relevant guest registers to and from this trapframe struct.

Skim Chapter 26 of the [Intel manual](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf) to familiarize yourself with the vmlaunch and vmresume instructions. Complete the assembly code in `asm_vmrun()` in vmm/vmx.c. Also remove the panic in the call to `asm_vmrun()`.

Once this is complete, you should be able to run the VM until the guest attempts a vmcall instruction, which traps to the host kernel. Because the host isn't handling traps from the guest yet, the VM will be terminated. You should see an error like `Unhandled VMEXIT, aborting guest.`

### Part 2 - Handling VM exits
The equivalent event to a trap from an application to the operating system is called a VM exit. We have provided some skeleton code to dispatch the major types of exits we expect our guest to provide in the vmm/vmx.c function `vmexit()`. You will need to identify the reason for the exit from the VMCS, as well as implement handler functions for certain events in vmm/vmexits.c.

Similar to issuing a system call (e.g., using the int or syscall instruction), a guest can programmatically trap to the host using the vmcall instruction (sometimes called hypercalls). The current JOS guest uses three hypercalls: one to read the e820 map, which specifies the physical memory layout to the OS; and two to use host-level IPC, discussed below.

#### Multi-boot map (aka e820)
JOS is "told" the amount of physical memory it has by the bootloader. JOS's bootloader passes the kernel a multiboot info structure which possibly contains the physical memory map of the system. The memory map may exclude regions of memory that are in use for reasons including IO mappings for devices (e.g., the "memory hole"), space reserved for the BIOS, or physically damaged memory. For more details on how this structure looks and what it contains, refer to the [specification](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html). A typical physical memory map for a PC with 10 GB of memory looks like below.
```
        e820 MEMORY MAP
        address: 0x0000000000000000, length: 0x000000000009f400, type: USABLE
        address: 0x000000000009f400, length: 0x0000000000000c00, type: RESERVED
        address: 0x00000000000f0000, length: 0x0000000000010000, type: RESERVED
        address: 0x0000000000100000, length: 0x00000000dfefd000, type: USABLE
        address: 0x00000000dfffd000, length: 0x0000000000003000, type: RESERVED
        address: 0x00000000fffc0000, length: 0x0000000000040000, type: RESERVED
        address: 0x0000000100000000, length: 0x00000001a0000000, type: USABLE
```

For the JOS guest, rather than emulate a BIOS, we will simply use a vmcall to request a "fake" memory map. Complete the implementation of `vmexit()` by identifying the reason for the exit from the VMCS. You may need to search Chapter 27 of the [Intel manual](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3c-part-3-manual.pdf) to solve this part of the exercise.
Implement the `VMX_VMCALL_MBMAP` case of the function `handle_vmcall()` in vmm/vmexits.c. Also, be sure to advance the instruction pointer so that the guest doesn't get in an infinite loop. Once the guest gets a little further in boot, it will attempt to discover whether the CPU supports long mode, using the cpuid instruction. Our VMCS is configured to trap on this instruction, so that we can emulate it---hiding the presence of vmx, since we have not implemented emulation of vmx in software. Now you will see an error of the form `kernel panic on CPU 0 at ../vmm/vmexits.c:262: cpuid not implemented`.

Implement `handle_cpuid()` in vmm/vmexits.c. When the host can emulate the cpuid instruction, your guest should run until it attempts to perform disk I/O, giving an error of the form `Unhandled VMEXIT, aborting guest.`

JOS has a user-level file system server daemon, similar to a microkernel. We place the guest's disk image as a file on the host file system server. When the guest file system daemon requests disk reads, rather than issuing ide-level commands, we will instead use vmcalls to ask the host file system daemon for regions of the disk image file. This is depicted in the image below.
![alt text](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/cs378-f17/projects/disk-architecture.jpg)

Once this is completed, you need to modify the `bc_pgfault()` amd `flush_block()` in fs/bc.c to issue I/O requests using the `host_read()` and `host_write()` hypercalls. Use the macro VMM_GUEST to select different behavior for the guest and host OS. You will also have to implement the IPC send and receive hypercalls in `handle_vmcall()`, as well as the client code to issue `ipc_host_send()` and `ipc_host_recv()` vmcalls in lib/ipc.c.

Finally, you will need to extend the `sys_ipc_try_send()` to detect whether the environment is of type `ENV_TYPE_GUEST` or not, and you also need to implement the `ept_page_insert()` function.

The workflow (and hints) for the ipc_* functions is as follows:
1. `ipc_host_send()` checks whether pg is NULL. If it is, it sets the pg to UTOP. Then this function gets the gpa corresponding to pg and does a vmcall to VMX_VMCALL_IPCSEND by setting the corresponding registers in the guest.
2. `ipc_host_recv()` also checks whether pg is NULL. If it is, it sets the pg to UTOP. Then it allocates a page at pg and does a vmcall to VMX_VMCALL_IPCRECV with corresponding registers set at the guest.
3. `handle_vmcall(): VMX_VMCALL_IPCSEND` loads the values from the trapframe registers. Then it ensures that the destination environment is HOST FS. If the destination environment is not HOST FS, then this function returns E_INVAL. Now, this function traverses all the environments, and sets the `to_env` to the environment ID corresponding to ENV_TYPE_FS at the host. After this is done, it converts the gpa to hva and then calls `sys_ipc_try_send()`
4. `handle_vmcall(): VMX_VMCALL_IPCRECV` just calls `sys_ipc_recv()`, after incrementing the program counter.
5. `sys_ipc_try_send()` checks whether the guest is sending a message to the host or whether the host is sending a message to the guest. If the curenv type is GUEST and the destination va is below UTOP, it means that the guest is sending a message to the host and it should insert a page in the host's page table. If the dest environment is GUEST and the source va is below UTOP, it means that the host is sending a message to the guest and it should insert a page in the EPT. Finally, at the end of this function, if the dest environment is GUEST, then the rsi register of the trapframe should be set with 'value'.
6. `ept_page_insert()` uses `ept_lookup_gpa` to traverse the EPT and insert a page if not present.

Once these steps are complete, you should have a fully running JOS-on-JOS.

### Grading
Your code will be tested on proper functioning of extended page table mapping, vmlaunch and resume and correct handling of vmcalls during vm exit.

Grade Scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/vijay03/cs378-f19/blob/master/gradeproject.py) and [here](https://github.com/vijay03/cs378-f19/blob/master/gradelib.py). Download both executables and run `python gradeproject.py` from the project-1 directory.

Note: This is just a script for your reference - the score that the script generates might not be your final grade for the project. The script will be most helpful in testing sys_ept_map() functionality and will be able to catch some of the problems that occur later on in the project due to incorrect mapping code.

### Hints
All the functions to be implemented contain hints on how to implement the respective functions as comments in the function names. So please pay attention to the commented code as well.
