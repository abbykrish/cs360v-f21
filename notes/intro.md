* Welcome to CS 378! We are going to learn about virtualization
technologies, and we are going to do some interesting projects. This
is a project-intensive course.

* I **don't teach with slides**. This is going to be a
  discussion-based class. I'll make notes like these available, but
  you need to pay attention in class. There are no textbooks for this course.

* Grading:
    * No midterms or finals!
    * 50% Project: implementing your own hypervisor
    * 50% Project: contributing to an open-source repository related to virtualization
    
* There are two projects in this class: an implementation-based
  project and an open-source project. Most of the learning will come
  from doing the projects!

* Students work in groups for 2--4 for all projects    

* You can optionally do a research project with me instead of the
  open-source project. Come talk to me early if you want to do this.
    
* Students learn a lot from doing the open-source project, but it
  takes a lot of time to set up. Start work on this early!
    
* History of Virtualization
    * Virtual machines go back to at least 1970: [PDP-10 Virtual Machines](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803947)
    * Seminal work came out around this time: [Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures, 1974](https://profsandhu.com/cs6393_s14/popek-goldberg-1974.pdf)
    * Virtual machines started off as functional, but having poor performance
    * A lot of progress towards good performance was made by 1997, resulting in another seminal paper: [Disco: Running Commodity Operating Systems on Scalable Multiprocessors](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/os/Qual/papers/disco.pdf)
    * VMware started in 1998
    * VMware Workstation in 1999
    * VMware ESX Server in 2001
    * [Xen](http://cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/csl862-virt/readings/2003-xensosp.pdf) paper in SOSP 2003
    * [Nested virtualization](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Ben-Yehuda.pdf) paper in OSDI 2010
    * Docker introduced containers in 2013
    * [Unikernels Queue article](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/teaching/CS508.19/papers/madhavapeddy13.pdf) comes out in 2013
    * AWS Lambda introduced in November 2014
    
* The main force driving progress in virtualization is **economics**: virtualization allows better utilization of hardware for the provider, and lower costs for the user
